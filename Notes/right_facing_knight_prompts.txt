Create a 2D sprite sheet of Sir Arthur Boland in the same semi‑realistic, stylized illustration style as the reference image. Depict him as a noble medieval knight with shoulder‑length blonde hair, a confident expression, and full silver plate armor rendered with detailed shading, strong highlights, and clean, deliberate outlines. Include armor elements such as the breastplate, pauldrons, gauntlets, greaves, and sabatons, all with a polished metallic finish. He stands upright in a strict right‑facing side profile, holding a straight‑bladed sword with a golden crossguard in his right hand and a large, cracked kite shield with a reinforced rim in his left hand. Maintain the same proportions, silhouette, and visual identity as the reference artwork. Generate a 4‑frame idle animation showing subtle breathing or posture shifts. Each frame must be exactly 256×256 pixels, arranged in a single horizontal row on a transparent background. Use crisp, high‑detail illustration rather than retro pixel art. Prioritize clean outlines, high‑contrast shading, and consistent character proportions across all frames to ensure the sprite sheet is visually cohesive.
